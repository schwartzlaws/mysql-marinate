1. When would you use a weak entity?


2. Is it better to use entities instead of attributes?


3. Alter and extend the music database ER model so that it can store 
compilations, where a compilation is an album that contains tracks by two 
or more different artists.

4. Create an ER diagram for an online media store using the following requirements:
 - There are two types of product: music CDs and video DVDs.
 - Customers can buy any number of each product.
 - For each CD, store the title, the artist’s name, the label (publisher), 
   and the price. Also store the number, title, and length (in seconds) 
   of each track on the CD.
 - For each video DVD, store the title the studio name, and the price.

Tables 4-1 and 4-2 contain some sample data to help you better understand 
the requirements.

If you are using Visio, Mike Murphy points out that there is a stencil by 
Daniel Harris that worked for him at 
http://www.visiocafe.com/downloads/various/DanielHarris/Chen_ER.zip

This directory also contains a Diagram4_11.odg file with Diagram 4-11, for use in question 3, and
as a model for question 4.
The .odg file was created on Open Office, but all compatibile programs can be seen at:
http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/odg

Or you can just hand-draw diagrams for questions 3 and 4 and take a picture, as in the Diagram4_11.jpg file.
