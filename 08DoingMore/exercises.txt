Exercises for Chapter 8

1) Write the monitor command to import the file academics.tsv, 
which has its values separated by tabs, into the details table.
 Hint: the tab character is shown with the \t escape sequence.

LOAD DATA INFILE '/Users/Lawrence/academics.tsv' INTO TABLE details FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t';

2) When would you need to insert data using a query?

This handy method lets you create tables based on existing data sources

3) Whatâ€™s the difference between REPLACE and INSERT IGNORE?

Per page 293 -- 
INSERT IGNORE kept the existing data with the duplicate key and does not insert the new row
REPLACE deletes the existing row and replaces it with the new one


4) What can you tell from this output produced by the EXPLAIN command?

    3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

* This has three simple select statements (no unions or suqueries)
* It is referring to the supervisor, student and supervises tables
* All the rosin the student table are being processed, but just the index for the supervise table.
* The supervisor table has the primary key
* The two key lengths employed are 4 (for supervisor) and 12 (for supervises)
* This will potentially process 95 rows in the student table and 570 in the supervises table
* where and distinct are used on the supervises table

    5 rows in set (0.01 sec)


* THis utilizes the union call
* The tables in question are played, track, and a union of the two
* The index is used on the played table
* THe primary key lengths for the played table is 10, and for the track table, 6
* The ref notes two key columns that are used with the track table
* expect 12 rows of the played tablee to be processed
* This will use some type of file sort.
